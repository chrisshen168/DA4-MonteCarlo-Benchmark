## Comparison of Create, Read, Update, Delete Operation Times for SQLite in Go and Python

## The data folder contains two series of datasets in different datatypes. Both series were randomly generated by running DataPrep.py in the main repo, and the xxx02 was used to update the xxx01.

## The Go-compatible SQLite drivers included: github.com/glebarez/go-sqlite (SQ1, cgo-free), modernc.org/sqlite (SQ2, cgo-free, as embedded in PocketBase), github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 (SQ3, cgo-dependent, requiring gcc-enabling environment).

## Results in the table 1 and table 2 were generated by running the MC-Benchmark.py (in Jupyter Notebook) and 4 similarly named go files at command line interface. 

## The abbreviations used for the field names in the table 1 and table 2 are explained as follows: Create (C), Read (R), Update (U), Delete (D), Create2 (Câ€², for the second table, created and data-inserted in UpdateOverall), UpdateOverall (O, for UpdateOverall = Create2 + Update) and Total (T) Operation Times. Corresponding to the 4 Go files, G1= Go + SQ1; G4 = Go + SQ2: G5 = Go + SQ3; G6 = Go + SQ3 + all data treated as string values; Py = Python.
